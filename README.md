This is the Git-Hub Repository of the Team - DeepAttack for the Deep Learning Final Project where we have published our results in the Project channel in Slack under the same team name and In this Repository we have included the Codebase in the form of a Jupyter Notebook File, and we have included the Report as well.

Along with that I have tried including the output files (.pt) files but there was memory constraint anyways the outputs were displayed in the python notebook and report clearly. When we had uploaded our results in the Slack channel, professor has reviewed them and have given remark as "great". Proceeding with the remark we have mode some minor changes and achieved even better output as stated in our message.

For reference I have also attached the questionnaire and dataset of the project provided by the professor and this is a ReadME file for explaining what exactly does this Repository Contain.

Me and my Teammate would like to express our gratitude to the Professor and TA's for guiding us through outt the course and helping us learn new interesting topics and helping us in performing well in our assignments and projects.
